I'm a PhD student in machine learning, working at the Computer Vision and Learning Lab of Heidelberg University. My research interests include generative models, geometric deep learning and the application of machine learning to the sciences, particularly particle physics. In my spare time I play in an acoustic folk duo with my wife, sing in choirs and cook Italian food.
